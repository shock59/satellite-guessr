# SatelliteGuessr

A simple game where you need to guess where in the world a satellite image was taken. You can zoom the image out if you're finding it hard. This was made for Hack Club Siege with the theme "space".

This game was inspired by [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/). It uses [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/) data [converted to GeoJSON by Martyn Afford](https://github.com/martynafford/natural-earth-geojson), and satellite map tiles from [Esri](http://esri.com) using images from Esri, i-cubed, USDA, USGS, AEX, GeoEye, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, UPR-EGP, and the GIS User Community. The background image is from [NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/).
